Set up the game initially
    Create a game board
        1. Initialize board constructor with variable size,# of mines, and a new array list called board
        2. Create a method to render the board, loop through the 2d arraylist, and print it out
        3. Have a method to create a 2D array with the size as the number of columns and rows
        4. Create method to render Column numbers and insert it next to the board
        5. Create method to insert the necessary number bombs into random coordinates using for loop
        (Have math.random() to create x and y coordinates.)
        (If there is already a bomb in the coordinate then you get new coordinates)
        6. Have a method openAllCells if the player loses to show all the cells.

    Create a player
        1. Initialize player constructor with variable name
        2. Create method askForCoordinates
        (Display message asking for x and y coordinates and returns an array with the coords)
        3. Create method coordinateIsOnBoard
        (IF coordinates are outside of the board, print error message and return false, else return true)
        4. Create method getCoordinates
        (Checks if coordinates are valid using other methods and returns the valid coordinates, loops askForCoordinates if invalid)
    Create a cell class
        1. Have a open/close status for the cells in the board
        2. It is a ? if closed and it is cellValue when true
        3. The cell Object will have a value and coordinates
Start the game loop
    Render the board
    Ask for and validate the player's coordinates
    If the game ends
        Display the proper victory / loss message
        Stop looping
    Else
        Map hints on the board and keep looping
